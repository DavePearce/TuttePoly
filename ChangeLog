V0.9.8
====================================================================

1) Support for evaluating polynomials using gmp.  By default,
computation is done using my biguint class, whilst evaluation of the
polynomial is done with gmp.

2) Flag for preventing cache resets on batch jobs.  This is enabled
using the switch "--no-reset".

3) Support for evaluating the polynomials at arbitrary points.  You
supply "-Tx,y" and it will evaluate at x,y once the computation is
complete.  You can pass as many "-Tx,y" switches as you like and it
will do them all.
	
4) Graphs read in are compacted properly now; so it doesn't matter
whether or not the vertex space is contiguous or starts from 0.
