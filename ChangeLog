v0.9.9
====================================================================

1) Modified the compilation procedure to use automake and autoconf.  
Thus, the distribution now comes with a configure script.

2) Changed Biguint to employ padding for unbounded, heap allocated
integers.  The advantage of this is that when adding/multiplying two
large integers together, the operation may still be able to be
performed in place.  

3) Optimise the factor_poly slightly as well to eliminate situations
where it reallocates memory unnecessarily.

4) Optimised tutte.cpp by removing select_line option, since it's
rather slow.

5) Other optimisations to tutte.cpp

6) Added support for computing Flow and Chromatic polynomials.

	
====================================================================
v0.9.8
====================================================================

1) Support for evaluating polynomials using gmp.  By default,
computation is done using my biguint class, whilst evaluation of the
polynomial is done with gmp.

2) Flag for preventing cache resets on batch jobs.  This is enabled
using the switch "--no-reset".

3) Support for evaluating the polynomials at arbitrary points.  You
supply "-Tx,y" and it will evaluate at x,y once the computation is
complete.  You can pass as many "-Tx,y" switches as you like and it
will do them all.
	
4) Graphs read in are compacted properly now; so it doesn't matter
whether or not the vertex space is contiguous or starts from 0.
