Tutte Polynomial Generator (v0.9.X)
===================================

This is an early release of a program for computing tutte polynomials
for undirected graphs.  As such, this version has had relatively
little testing done on it and should be considered EXTREMELY
EXPERIMENTAL.  There are almost certainly outstanding bugs in the code
remaining to be fixed.  As such, this software is provided as is, and
the authors and their respective insititutions accept no
responsibility for any problem arising from the use of this software.

We would appreciate any bug reports you have and/or suggestions on
improving the code.  We'd also be very interested in hearing about
anyone interested in using the code for research (or other) purposes.
In particular, whether or not the current version is fast enough to
process the input graphs you want.

If you wish to be notified of updates to this software, please let us
know.

Thanks!

isomorphic or not.  You can find more information about this program

Installation Instructions 
=========================

To compile the system, run the following:

> ./configure
> make

This will build the executable "tutte" in the directory tutte/.  If
you do not have the GMP library installed, you will need to disable
GMP support by passing "--disable-gmp" to configure.  

The configure script accepts many options, and to get a full list of
them simply run "./configure --help".

The system has been sucessfully compiled on the following platforms:

1) NetBSD + Linux with GCC 4.1.2
2) Windows (under Cygwin) with GCC 4.1.?

Command-line Options
====================

Currently, the tutte program accepts a number of command-line options.
You can run "tutte --help" to see a list.  We will not examine all of
them here, but there are a few which you should know about:

"-c<x> --cache-size=<x>" 

The system uses an internal cache to store previously seen subgraphs,
in order to prevent their (unnecessary) recomputation.  The size of
this cache will certainly affect performance for largish (>15
vertices) input graphs.  

We do not recommend giving all available physical RAM to the cache,
since this will result in thrashing.  Instead, 80--90% of physical RAM
is ideal.  For example, suppose your machine has 1GB of physical RAM.
Then, we'd use the switch "-c800M" to allocate 800 Megabytes of it to
the internal cache.

"-i --info" 

This gives some information on the size of the computation tree which
can be useful.  In particular, it tells you the size of the
computation tree and gives values for T(1,1) and T(2,2) which can be
used to help verify correctness.

"--vertex-ordering"

This selects an alternative edge selection heuristic which is known to
perform better than the default on some graphs.  It may be that this
should be the default, and you may find using this will improve
performance dramatically for your problem.

An example command-line we might us is:

tutte -ic800M --vertex-ordering ../examples/edge20
