Things to do!
=============

For Gordon
----------
* Update timing reporting
* Expand polynomial
* ?

Webpage
-------
* Build one!
* Get permission for using nauty in code? Don't need to ... the license gives permission.

Code Improvements
-----------------
* Fix factor poly to permit general multiplications
* Refactor graph_key to be a class somehow.  Might make sense for it to simply produce a bitstring.  Then, we have a
  function which produces a bitstring from a graph ... similar to what we have now.
* Add support for decent stats reporting [breakdown of bucket length, proportion of memory used by graphs vs polynomial]
* Add copyright messages.

Easy Ideas
----------
* Remove pendant multi-edges
* Add Gary's small graph isomorphism tests
* Removing "lines" by checking that one of their vertices is not on the spanning tree.  Adjust spanning tree to pick "bushy" vertices.
* Remove triangles and other things?
* Add support for more cache replacement policies
* Add alternative(s) to adjacency list (i.e. Gary's optimised for contracting)
* Fixup BIGUINT so it packs (i.e. removes trailing zeros) automatically and optimise multiplication?

Hard Ideas
----------
* Investigate the multi-edge matching idea, where number of multiple edges is not important.
* Refactor polynomial to simplify it after computing
* Use template matching for multi-graphs
* Consider incremental isomorphism algorithm?
* Consider truely distributed implementation?

Other things
------------
* Focus on generating more stats.  E.g. locality of hit info, number of immediate collapses?

Known Bugs
----------
* safe_arithmetic.hpp is not safe for multiplication
