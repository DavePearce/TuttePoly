Things to do!
=============

* Add support for cache replacement policies and garbage collection
* Add Gary's small graph isomorphism tests
* Add support for integer overflow
* Add support for decent stats reporting [breakdown of bucket length, proportion of memory used by graphs vs polynomial]

Alternative Implementations
---------------------------
* Add vecmultiset option for adjacency list
* Add alternative(s) to adjacency list (i.e. Gary's optimised for contracting)
* Add alternative(s) to simple poly for representing polynomials

Optimisations
-------------
* Threshold support
* Optimise space used by nauty graphs
* Optimise cache lookup policies (i.e. don't convert to nauty graph
  unless really need to, possibly by using bins for different size graph) 
  Could use things like min-max degree to help compare graphs?
* Optimise updating of canonical graph to prevent recomputing every time?
* Optimise of hashing policy?
* Explore nauty options?
* Search for multiple edge of tree edge for removal as this means spaning tree is unchanged.
