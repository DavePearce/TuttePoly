Things to do!
=============

Code Improvements
-----------------
* Refactor graph_key to be a class.  This might simplify a few things, but it's hard to keep it as efficient.
* Add support for decent stats reporting [breakdown of bucket length, proportion of memory used by graphs vs polynomial]

Easy Ideas
----------
* Add Gary's small graph isomorphism tests
* Removing "lines" by checking that one of their vertices is not on the spanning tree.  Adjust spanning tree to pick "bushy" vertices.
* Add support for more cache replacement policies
* Add alternative(s) to adjacency list (i.e. Gary's optimised for contracting)
* Fixup BIGUINT so it packs (i.e. removes trailing zeros) automatically and optimise multiplication?

Hard Ideas
----------
* Investigate the multi-edge matching idea, where number of multiple edges is not important.
* Refactor polynomial to simplify it after computing
* Use template matching for multi-graphs
* Consider incremental isomorphism algorithm?
* Consider truely distributed implementation?
