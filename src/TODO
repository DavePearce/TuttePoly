Things to do!
=============

* Add support for cache replacement policies and garbage collection
* Add Gary's Triangle optimisation
* Add Gary's small graph isomorphism tests
* Add support for integer overflow

Alternative Implementations
---------------------------
* Add vecmultiset option for adjacency list
* Add alternative(s) to adjacency list (i.e. Gary's optimised for contracting)
* Add alternative(s) to simple poly for representing polynomials

Optimisations
-------------
* Optimise space used by nauty graphs
* Optimise cache lookup policies (i.e. don't convert to nauty graph
  unless really need to, possibly by using bins for different size graph) 
* Optimise updating of canonical graph to prevent recomputing every time?
* Optimise of hashing policy?
* Explore nauty options?

Other
-----
* Start using new version of nauty
